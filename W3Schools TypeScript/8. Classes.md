# TypeScript Classes

> TypeScript adds types and visibility modifiers to JavaScript `classes`.

## Members

`Members` of a class are the `properties` and/or `methods` inside of that class.

---

## Members: Types

The `members` of a class are typed using type annotations, just like variables.

```
class Person {
   name: string;     <-- name property set to string type inside Person class
};

const person = new Person();
person.name = "Jane";
```

## Members: Visibility

Class `members` are also given special modifiers which affect visibility.

> There are <u>**three**</u> main visibility modifiers in TypeScript, the three `P's`:
> 
> - **`public`** - This is the default option. We can access this class member from ***anywhere***
> - **`private`** - We can ***only*** access this class member from within/inside the class
> - **`protected`** - We can access this class member from ***itself and any classes that inherit it***

Put any of these visibility modifiers `keywords` in front of any class `member` to set each modifier.

```
class Person {
   // won't be able to access this class member
   private name: string;

   // constructors should be public or else you can't create new classes with constructors set to private
   public constructor(name: string) {
      this.name = name;
   }

   // can see name property, even though it's set to private, because the method is set to public
   public getName(): string {
      return this.name;
   }
};

const person = new Person("John");
person.name;      // not accessible or viewable from outside of the class because it's set to private
```
