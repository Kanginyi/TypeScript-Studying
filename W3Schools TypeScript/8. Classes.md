# TypeScript Classes

> TypeScript adds types and visibility modifiers to JavaScript `classes`.

## Members

`Members` of a class are the `properties` and/or `methods` inside of that class.

---

## Members: Types

The `members` of a class are typed using type annotations, just like variables.

```
class Person {
   name: string;     <-- name property set to string type inside Person class
};

const person = new Person();
person.name = "Jane";
```

## Members: Visibility

Class `members` are also given special modifiers which affect visibility.

> There are <u>**three**</u> main visibility modifiers in TypeScript, the three `P's`:
> 
> - **`public`** - This is the default option. We can access this class member from ***anywhere***
> - **`private`** - We can ***only*** access this class member from within/inside the class
> - **`protected`** - We can access this class member from ***itself and any classes that inherit it***

Put any of these visibility modifiers `keywords` in front of any class `member` to set each modifier.

```
class Person {
   // won't be able to access this class member
   private name: string;

   // constructors should be public or else you can't create new classes with constructors set to private
   public constructor(name: string) {
      this.name = name;
   }

   // can see name property, even though it's set to private, because the method is set to public
   public getName(): string {
      return this.name;
   }
};

const person = new Person("John");
person.name;      // not accessible or viewable from outside of the class because it's set to private
```

## Parameter Properties

TypeScipt provides an easy way to define class `members` inside the constructor. We can add a visibility modifier to the parameter taken in when using the class constructor.

```
class Person {
   // name is a private class member variable
   public constructor(private name: string) {

   }

   public getName(): string {
      return this.name;
   }
};

const person = new Person("Jane");
person.name;            // not accessible or viewable from outside of the class because it's set to private inside of the constructor parameter
```

## Readonly

Similar to how it interacts with arrays, the `readonly` keyword can prevent class `members` from being changed or updated.

```
class Person {
   // name cannot be changed because it's readonly
   public readonly name: string;

   public constructor(name: string) {
      // name cannot be changed after this initial definition, which is either at its declaration or inside the constructor
      this.name = name;
   }

   public getName(): string {
      return this.name;
   }
};

const person = new Person("Jimmy");    // name is currently Jimmy

person.name = "Jenny";                 // cannot reassign because name is a readonly property
```
