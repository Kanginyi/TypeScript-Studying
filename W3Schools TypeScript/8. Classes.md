# TypeScript Classes

> TypeScript adds types and visibility modifiers to JavaScript `classes`.

## Members

`Members` of a class are the `properties` and/or `methods` inside of that class.

---

## Members: Types

The `members` of a class are typed using type annotations, just like variables.

```
class Person {
   name: string;     <-- name property set to string type inside Person class
};

const person = new Person();
person.name = "Jane";
```

## Members: Visibility

Class `members` are also given special modifiers which affect visibility.
