# Objects

Here's an example of TypeScript's object type syntax:

```
const person: {name: string, age: number, job: string} = {
   name: "John Doe",
   age: 123,
   job: "Professional Napper"
};
```

Object types can also be written separately and be more reusable in things called `interfaces`.

## Type Inference

TypeScript can also infer the types of properties based on their values.

```
const you = {
   cool: false
};

you.cool = true;     // no error
you.cool = "no";     // tries to reassign boolean to a string
```

## Optional Properties

Optional properties are proprties that don't have to be defined when creating an object

> optionalProperty`?` <-- Add a `?` after the optional property you want

```
const pet: {name: string, collar?: boolean} = {
   name: "Spot"
};
// No error, but would run one if the collar property wasn't set to be optional
```

## Index Signatures

Index signatures can be used to define types for objects without a defined list of properties or values.

```
// Define personAge with a key of string type and value of number type
const personAge: {[name: string]: number} = {};

personAge.Jane = 123;
// no error, since the property/key is string type and the value is number type

personAge.John = "One Two Three";
// runs an error, can't assign string type when expecting number type for value

const booleanType = true;
personAge[booleanType] = 321;
// runs an error, can't assign boolean type when expecting string type for property/key
```
