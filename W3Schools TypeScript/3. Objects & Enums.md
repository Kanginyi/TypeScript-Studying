# Objects

Here's an example of TypeScript's object type syntax:

```
const person: {name: string, age: number, job: string} = {
   name: "John Doe",
   age: 123,
   job: "Professional Napper"
};
```

Object types can also be written separately and be more reusable in things called `interfaces`.

## Type Inference

TypeScript can also infer the types of properties based on their values.

```
const you = {
   cool: false
};

you.cool = true;     // no error
you.cool = "no";     // tries to reassign boolean to a string
```

## Optional Properties

Optional properties are proprties that don't have to be defined when creating an object

> optionalProperty`?` <-- Add a `?` after the optional property we want

```
const pet: {name: string, collar?: boolean} = {
   name: "Spot"
};
// No error, but would run one if the collar property wasn't set to be optional
```

## Index Signatures

Index signatures can be used to define types for objects without a defined list of properties or values.

```
// Define personAge with a key of string type and value of number type
const personAge: {[name: string]: number} = {};

personAge.Jane = 123;
// no error, since the property/key is string type and the value is number type

personAge.John = "One Two Three";
// runs an error, can't assign string type when expecting number type for value

const booleanType = true;
personAge[booleanType] = 321;
// runs an error, can't assign boolean type when expecting string type for property/key
```

# Enums

An **enum** is a special *class* that represents a group of unchangeable variables.  
Enums come in two *options*: `string` and `numeric`.

TypeScript enums should be written in **`PascalCase`**.

`enum` is a keyword to define something, just like `let` or `const`.

## Numeric Enums (Default)

By default, enums will initialize their first value to `0` and increment by 1 to each following value in order:

```
enum CardinalDirections {
   North,      // 0
   East,       // 1
   South,      // 2
   West        // 3
};

let currentDirection = CardinalDirections.North;   // 0

currentDirection = "North";
// runs error, "North" is not assignable to type "CardinalDirections"
// We're dealing with numeric enums right now, not string enums
```

## Numeric Enums (Initialized)

We can also set the value of the first numeric enum value and it'll increment by 1 to each following value after that:

```
enum CardinalDirections {
   North = 66,    // 66
   East,          // 67
   South,         // 68
   West           // 69
};
```

## Numeric Enums (Partially Initialized)

We don't only have to set the first numeric enum value. We can choose to set and omit values as we see fit. If we omit values, their value will be incremented from the previous value.

```
enum StatusCodes {
   NotFound = 404,      // 404
   Ok = 200,            // 200
   Created,             // 201, incremented from previous value
   Accepted,            // 202, incremented from previous value
   BadRequest = 400,    // 400
};
```

## Numeric Enums (Fully Initialized)

We can fully set unique number values for each enum value. The values will **NOT** automatically increment.

> Each value inside of the enum doesn't actually need to be unique. BUT WHY MAN.

```
enum StatusCodes {
   NotFound = 404,
   Ok = 200,
   BadRequest = 400,
   Accepted = 202,
   InternalServerError = 500
};
```

## String Enums

Enums can also contain `strings`. This is more common than `numeric` enums, because of their readability and intent.

```
enum CardinalDirections {
   North = "North",
   East = "East",
   South = "South",
   West = "West"
};
```

> For `string` enums, we need to fully initialize each value.

```
enum CardinalDirections {
   North = "North",
   East = "East",
   South,
   West = "West"
};

// Runs an error, each enum member must have initializer
```

## Mixing String & Numeric Enums

Technically, we can mix and match `string` and `numeric` enum values, but it is ***NOT RECOMMENDED TO DO SO***.

```
enum StatusCodes {
   NotFound = "Nonono not found",
   Ok = 200,
   Created,          // 201
   Accepted,         // 202
   InternalServerError = "Server's causing issues"
};
```
