# Type Aliases

`Type aliases` allow defining types with a custom name (or `Alias`).

Type aliases can be used for either primitive data types like `string` or complex data types like `objects` or `arrays`.

Creating type aliases for a person:

```
type PersonName = string;
type PersonAge = number;
type PersonJob = string;

type Person = {
   name: PersonName,    // name property with PersonName type (string type)
   age: PersonAge,      // age property with PersonAge type (number type)
   job: PersonJob       // job property with PersonJob type (string type)
};
```

Using the created person type aliases as type values:

```
const billName: PersonName = "Bill Nye";
const billAge: PersonAge = 123;
const billJob: PersonJob = "The Science Guy";

const billNye: Person = {
   name: billName,   // Bill Nye, string type from PersonName alias
   age: billAge,     // 123, number type from PersonAge alias
   job: billJob      // The Science Guy, string type from PersonJob alias
};
```

---

# Interfaces

`Interfaces` are essentially identical to type aliases, BUT they **ONLY** apply to `object` types.

```
interface Person {
   name: string,
   age: number,
   job: string
};

const billNye: Person = {
   name: "Bill Nye",
   age: 123,
   job: "The Science Guy"
};
// Runs no error because all the types of the billNye object match with the preset interface types
```

## Extending Interfaces

`Interfaces` can also do something called **`extend`** each other's definitions.

> **`Extending`** an interface means we're creating a new interface with all the same properties as the original, PLUS other new properties.  \
> We use the `extend` keyword to do this.

Here's an example using the previous Person interface:

```
interface PersonFavColor extends Person {
   color: string        // Adds new property to Person interface
};

const samuraiJack: PersonFavColor = {
   name: "Jack",
   age: 321,
   job: "Samurai",
   color: "white"
};
```
