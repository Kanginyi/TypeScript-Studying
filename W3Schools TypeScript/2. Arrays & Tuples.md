# Arrays

Here's an example of TypeScript's array type syntax:

```
const names: string[] = [];   // string[] is an array type of strings
names.push("yourName");       // adds a string type into array, so no error
names.push(321);         // can't add a number type into array type of strings
```

## Readonly

`readonly` as a keyword prevents arrays from being changed or mutated.

```
const names: readonly string[] = ["yourName"];
names.push("myName");   // Cannot change a readonly array
```

## Type Inference

TypeScript can also infer the type of an array if it's populated with values.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];  // infers as type number[]
numbers.push(4);            // no error

numbers.push("4");          // can't add a string type into array type of numbers
```

# Tuples

A **tuple** is a typed array with pre-defined length and types for each index.

To define a tuple, specify the type of each element in the array:

```
let wurmple: [string, number, boolean];    // define tuple
wurmple = ["this", 15, true];              // initialize tuple
```

The order of the elements inside of tuples matter. If set in the wrong order, TypeScript will throw an error.

## Readonly Tuple

A good practice is to make **tuples** `readonly`. This is because **tuples** ONLY have strongly defined types for its initial values.

```
const twople: readonly [string, boolean, number] = ["1", true, 3];
```

## React Tuple Example

An example of a tuple is React's `useState` hook.  
`useState` returns a tuple of a state value and a state setter function.

```
const [name, setName] = useState("");  // String and Function types1
```

## Named Tuples

**Named tuples** will not have any impact on type-checking. But the lack of labels on tuple element values can make them harder to use. We can use **named tuples** to communicate our intent.  

```
const purple: [name: string, hexcode: string] = ["purple", "#800080"];
```

## Destructuring Tuples

Since tuples are arrays, we can also destructure them:

```
const person: [string, number] = ["John Doe", 123];
const [name, age] = person;

console.log(name);   // "John Doe"
console.log(age);    // 123
```
