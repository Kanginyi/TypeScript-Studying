# Casting

There are certain times when working with **`types`** where it's necessary to override the initial type of a variable, such as when incorrect types are provided by an external library.

**`Casting`** is the process of *overriding* or *converting* a type from one to another.

In TypeScript, we can use either the `as` keyword or the `<>` operator for `castings`.

## Casting With the `as` Keyword

One way to `cast` a variable is using the **`as`** keyword, which will directly change the type of the chosen variable.

> const variableName: unknown = "unknown";
> 
> Cast with `(variableName as type)`

```
const greeting: unknown = "hello";

(greeting as string).length;     // directly changes from unknown type to string type
```
