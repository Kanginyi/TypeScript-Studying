# Casting

There are certain times when working with **`types`** where it's necessary to override the initial type of a variable, such as when incorrect types are provided by an external library.

**`Casting`** is the process of *overriding* or *converting* a type from one to another.

In TypeScript, we can use either the `as` keyword or the `<>` operator for `castings`.

## Casting With the `as` Keyword

One way to `cast` a variable is using the **`as`** keyword, which will directly change the type of the chosen variable.

> const variableName: unknown = "unknown";
> 
> Cast with --> `variableName as newType`

```
const greeting: unknown = "hello";

(greeting as string).length;     // directly changes from unknown type to string type; value is 5
```

### Potential Casting Errors

> `Casting` doesn't *actually* change the type of the data within the given variable.  
> For example, the following code example will not work as expected since the variable still holds the `number` type:

```
let typeDoesntChange: unknown = 123;      // number type

(typeDoesntChange as string).length;      // prints undefined because number types don't have a "length"
```

> TypeScript will still attempt to typecheck `casts` to prevents ones that don't seem correct.  
> For example, the following code example will throw a type error because TypeScript tries to guess that `casting` a string to a number *usually* doesn't make sense without first converting the data:

```
const four: number = 4;       // number type

(four as string).length;

// Error: Conversion of type 'number' to type 'string' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.

// While the above is a TypeScript casting error; if we check the length of "4" as a string type, we'll still expectedly get 1
```

## Casting with `<>`

Using `<>` to `cast` types works the same as `casting` with the `as` keyword.

> const variableName: unknown = "unknown";
> 
> Cast with --> `<newType>variableName`

```
const greeting: unknown = "hihi";

(<string>greeting).length;    // directly changes from unknown type to string type; value is 4
```

- As a heads up, this type of `casting` will <u>**NOT**</u> work with `TSX`, such as when working with TypeScript inside of React files.

## Force Casting

To override type errors that TypeScript might throw when `casting`, we can first `cast` to the `unknown` type, then to the desired target type.

> const variableName = "unknown";
> 
> Cast with --> `(variableName as unknown) as newType`

```
const greeting = "no";                       // no known type, currently inferred as string type

((greeting as unknown) as string).length;    // first cast to unknown type, then to string type; value is 2

((greeting as unknown) as number).length;    // prints undefined because greeting is not actually a number type and number types don't have a "length"
```
